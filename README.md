This is my Emerging Technologies assignment, it includes python files and Jupyter Notebook files that
can be viewed in the Jupyter Notebook found in Anaconda. 

## Getting Started

Initially to get these files on your local computer clone this repo to your selected directory.
```
git clone https://github.com/smcguire56/emtech-assignment
```

### Prerequisites

Before you clone this repo you must install anaconda from: 

[anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) - Anaconda Download

Make sure Jupyter Notebook is installed with Anaconda.

Make sure you have the data folder in the root directory which includes MNIST data.

[mnist](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) - MNIST Download



Also if you need to install tensorflow you can do so on cmd:
```
pip install tensorflow
```

### Installing

So to install this project to your local PC first open up CMD or your preferred command line e.g. cmder, git bash etc.

run the command: 

```
git clone https://github.com/smcguire56/emtech-assignment 
```

```
cd emtech-assignment
```

Now open up Jupyter Notebook, locate the emtech-assignment file you just cloned, and you can open up the .ipynb files from there.
